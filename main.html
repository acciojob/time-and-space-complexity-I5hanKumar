	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity in data structures is an efficient way to describe how much time an algorithm takes to execute each statement of code as the size of the input increases</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity </b>in data structures refers to the amount of memory an algorithm or data structure uses to solve a problem, relative to the size of the input data O(n)</p>
